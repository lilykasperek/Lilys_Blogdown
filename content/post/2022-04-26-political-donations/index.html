<h4>For my first post I decided to visualize the data of public political donations made by wealthy professional sports team owners in the United States. Each visualization is accompanied by some relevant questions and possible answers to those questions.</h4>

<h4>Even though many observations are repeated with many owners making up hundreds of different donations, this visualization aims to show how many donations are made by owners who own one team from six different professional sports leagues in the United States from 2016 to 2020. I only used team owners who own one team because I felt examining every observation by League would complicate the visualization, as hundreds of team owners own two or three teams across different Leagues. It must also be noted that I decided to exclude data points of donations that are not available or associated with Independent, Bipartisan but mostly Democratic, and Bipartisan but mostly Republican organizations. I decided to do this because there are minimal observations for these parties.</h4>

<h4>It appears many of these donations have been made by owners of MLB teams, even though as we’ll see later, Charles Johnson has made over 200 donations alone. However, this visualization also highlights the most expensive public donation made by owners in each league. Charles Johnson’s most expensive donation was over $1,500,000. Dan Gilbert made a staggering $1,250,000 donation as well. Ron Burke and Philip F. Anschutz have both made donations of $500,000. Janice S. McNair is close, with a donation of $449,000. Roger Penske made a $250,000 donation, and Kelly Loeffler donated $290,300.</h4>

<h4>As we saw from the previous visualization, Janice S. McNair, owner of the Houston Texans, made the highest public political donation of all NFL owners from 2016 to 2020 with a donation of $449,000. This visualization displays some of the other top spenders who are responsible for the 25 most expensive public donations made by NFL team owners in the United States in 2016. It seems as though a majority of these team owners make public donations to organizations affiliated with the Republican party. Considering the donations made by NFL team owners, it may not be unreasonable to think that American sports team owners are greatly influential in American elections and politics.</h4>
