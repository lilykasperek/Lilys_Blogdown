# President Salary

## If I would have had more time, I would have made visualizations using a data set detailing president and vice president salary. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
pvp_dataset <- read_csv(here("data/pvp_dataset.csv"))
pvp_dataset

pres_salary <- pvp_dataset %>% filter(position_title == "PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES")
pres_salary

ggplot(data = pres_salary, aes(x = salary, y = year)) +
  geom_line()

icons <- pres_salary %>% filter(name == "Washington,George" |
                                  name == "Lincoln,Abraham" |
                         name == "Roosevelt,Franklin Delano" |
                         name == "Nixon,Richard Milhous" |
                         name == "Bush,George Walker" |
                         name == "Obama,Barack Hussein,II" |
                         name == "Trump,Donald John")
icons

ggplot(data = icons, aes(x = name, y = salary)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
 
ggplot(data = pres_salary, aes(x = year, y = salary)) +
  geom_line()

ggplot(data = pres_salary, aes(x = year, y = salary, colour = salary)) +
  geom_line() 

pres_salary %>% group_by(party) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

ggplot(data = pres_salary, aes(x = salary, y = party)) +
  geom_point()
```
