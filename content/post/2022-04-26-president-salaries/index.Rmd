## New Data Set 

## Potential questions:

## How has President salary changed over time

## Is there a predominant party or evenly split 

## How much more do presidents make compared to vice presidents 

## Has salary ever increased from term to term 

## Aim for 4, with 1 being kable table!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
pvp_dataset <- read_csv("data/pvp_dataset.csv")
pvp_dataset

ggplot(data = pvp_dataset, aes(x = year, y = salary)) +
  geom_line()

pvp_dataset_2 <- read_csv("data/pvp_dataset 2.csv")
pvp_dataset_2

pres_salary <- pvp_dataset_2 %>% filter(position_title == "PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES")
pres_salary

ggplot(data = pres_salary, aes(x = year, y = salary)) +
  geom_line()

ggplot(data = pres_salary, aes(x = year, y = salary, colour = salary)) +
  geom_line() 

pres_salary %>% group_by(party) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

ggplot(data = pres_salary, aes(x = salary, y = party)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(data = pres_salary, aes(x = , y = party, colour = salary)) +
  geom_point()
```
