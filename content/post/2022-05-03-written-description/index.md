I am a sophomore at St. Lawrence University majoring in Psychology and minoring in Statistics. This is a personal blog designed to serve as my final project for STAT 4005/DATA 4001. The data I used for this project is public and was scraped from Kaggle. I wanted to use data that was somewhat similar and ultimately ended up using the public data of wealthy elites. My two posts contain visualizations examining the public political donations of American sports team owners and the characteristics of billionaires from the 2021 Forbes Billionaires List. I also included a third section that I wanted to complete but did not have enough time to. A more detailed written description can be found in the "About" tab. My GitHub is linked as well. The process of completing this project can be found in the repository titled "DataViz_Final_Project" and the actual project can be found in the repository called "Lilys_Blogdown"
