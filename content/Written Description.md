The general purpose of this project is to curate many different data visualizations using a variety of data sets. I want to create a personal website using blogdown to share these data visualizations. I decided to use data that was interesting to me, and found that I was most interested in data examining the political donations made by professional sport team owners from different leagues. 

Data Ethics: 
* Political donations are public information; scraped the data from Kaggle, did not realize until today (April 10th) that fivethirtyeright actually published a piece using this data but luckily the visualizations that I have already made are different from those on fivethirtyeight 
* did not exclude N/A for a party affiliation point because I did not think there was any reason other than making the legend look better 

Expressing Variability:
* Use scatter plots to show variability in data, and use bar plots to show the count of categorical variables 

Motivation and Grammar of Graphics:
* Used theme() for the style of my visualizations
